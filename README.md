# Watson – Tactical Intel Tool

**Watson** is a lightweight, secure intelligence tool built by intelligence professionals for intelligence professionals.

It helps you keep track of people, places, vehicles, objects, and relationships while drafting structured intelligence notes — especially during fast-moving incidents, investigations, or early-stage analysis. Everything is designed for speed, clarity, and field-readiness.

> Intel. Fast. Field-Ready.

## Purpose

Watson is not a full intelligence platform. It's a disposable tactical workspace for capturing observations, entities, and context before transferring them to a long-term system.

Use it when:
- Responding to a live incident
- Writing an initial brief or report under time pressure
- Building a timeline of key events
- Tracking entities and relationships before formal entry
- You need a fast, trusted tool that doesn't retain data

## Privacy and Security

Watson is designed for secure, short-term use in sensitive environments.

- 100% client-side, all data is stored in your browser tab only
- No server connection, sync, or cloud interaction
- No login, no tracking, no analytics
- Data persists only during the session unless explicitly saved
- All saved files are stored locally on your device

Nothing leaves your device. Watson is safe to use for pre-sanitised or sensitive information in disconnected, secure environments.
