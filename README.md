# Watson – Tactical Intel Tool

**Watson** is a lightweight, secure intelligence tool built by intelligence professionals for intelligence professionals.

It helps you keep track of people, places, and relationships while drafting structured intelligence notes — especially during fast-moving incidents, investigations, or early-stage analysis. Everything is designed for speed, clarity, and field-readiness.

> Intel. Fast. Field-Ready.

## Purpose

Watson is not a full intelligence platform. It’s a disposable tactical workspace for capturing observations, entities, and context before transferring them to a long-term system.

Use it when:
- Responding to a live incident
- Writing an initial brief or report under time pressure
- Tracking entities and relationships before formal entry
- You need a fast, trusted tool that doesn’t retain data

---

## Features

- Take structured intelligence notes in real time
- Track people, organisations, locations, and sources
- Map relationships between entities in an interactive network
- Visualise geographic connections and links
- Operates fully offline — no cloud, no account, no dependencies

---

## Privacy and Security

Watson is designed for secure, short-term use in sensitive environments.

- 100% client-side, all data is stored in your browser tab only
- No server connection, sync, or cloud interaction
- No login, no tracking, no analytics
- All data is cleared immediately when the tab is closed

Nothing leaves your device. Watson is safe to use for pre-sanitised or sensitive information in disconnected, secure environments.

## Open Source and Transparency

Watson is fully open source to ensure verifiable security and operational transparency.

- You can inspect the code to confirm that no data is sent or stored externally
- There are no hidden trackers, analytics, or background requests
- You are free to fork, audit, or self-host for complete control
